# Cryptocurrencies

## Description of Analysis
For this project, I analyzed data regarding multiple cryptocurrencies. I cleaned the data by only including cryptocurrencies that were being traded. After that I used an unsupervised machine learning model to predict clusters of data. I used the information from my model to create various visualizations that show the most successful cryptocurrencies based on their coin supply and the total amount of coins mined.
